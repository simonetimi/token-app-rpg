Token Bag App for RPG game

## How it works

- It starts with a bag with 15 good tokens and 1 bad token
- The user can draw from 1 to 3 tokens per turn. Every draw uses the same pool (15 + bad tokens)
- If the user draws a good token, a bad token will automatically be inserted
- The bag can have up to 6 bad tokens, then the user receives an alert
- The user has the ability to remove bad tokens as the game requires
- If the user draws a bad token, the bad will be reset to its original state
